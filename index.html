    <h1 id="heading">Welcome to Yoga Blog <span id="name"></span></h1>
    <p  id ="para">But I must explain to you how all this mistaken
      idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I 
      will give you a complete account of the system, and expound 
      the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, 
      the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, 
      dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure,
      but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure 
      rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. 
      Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires 
      to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because 
      occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can 
      procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, 
      which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, 
      except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any 
      right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure 
      that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain 
      that produces no resultant pleasure?"</p>
